<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
The node classification task is one where the algorithm has to determine the labelling of samples (represented as nodes) by looking at the labels of their neighbours. Link Prediction in a network is how to predict the likelihood of a link between two nodes in a network that have not yet produced a link, such as known network nodes and network structures. These two methods have played an important role in network science.

Deepwalk is a basic algorithm for network representation learning, which is used to learn the vector representation of vertices in the network.It can be used to solve link prediction and node classification problem.

In this project, we intend to solve the following two academic network problems using Deepwalk algorithm

1)Judge which of the 10 meetings each scholar has pub- lished in 2016-2019

2)Determine whether two scholars have collaborated in publishing articles in 2020
